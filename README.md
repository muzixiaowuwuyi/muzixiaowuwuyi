I'm a passionate front-end engineer. I'm proficient in multiple programming languages, including Python and JavaScript, and excel in various tasks based on JavaScript, both on the front end and back end. Before becoming a programmer, I was an accomplished designer. This design background has greatly aided my transition into a front-end engineer, enabling me to develop user-friendly interactive interfaces and exceptional UI designs.

Whether as a designer or now as a front-end engineer, I deeply understand the importance of teamwork. I've always been eager to contribute my skills to the team, bringing confidence and strength to the group.

My curiosity and enthusiasm for learning drive me to explore new domains continually. Leveraging my professional knowledge and blending design experience with coding abilities, I create engaging and practical applications.

Recently, I graduated from Codeworks' Software Engineering Immersive Courses, which broadened my knowledge and further enhanced my programming skills, along with accumulating valuable experience through hands-on projects. In this program, I learned how to excel as an engineer and build complex applications, gaining an in-depth understanding of JavaScript.
